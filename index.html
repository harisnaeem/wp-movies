<p>Attach data (including movie posters and backdrop images) from
TheMovieDb.org to your posts or events in WordPress.</p>

</a>

<p>The import pool suggests movie matches from TMDb based on your post titles. You can choose from the matches, or leave a post without a movie.</p>

<a href="screenshots/media.png">
    <img src="screenshots/media.png" alt="Attach Media to a Post" />
</a>

<p>Here we can see the import tool copied a poster and a backdrop image from TMDb for our post about <em>Back to the Future</em> and attached them as media to that post. It also set the backdrop image as the featured image, because we configured the plugin to do that.</p>

<a href="screenshots/viewpost.png">
    <img src="screenshots/viewpost.png" alt="Featured Image" />
</a>

<p>We see the featured image showing with our blog post or event post type on our public blog.</p>

<h1>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p>Download this package and upload to plugins:
<a href="https://github.com/zmcghee/wp-movies/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/zmcghee/wp-movies/archive/master.zip</a></p>

<p>After you activate the plugin, configure it by going to the <em>Settings</em>
screen under the <em>Movies</em> menu in your admin dashboard. You'll need a
TMDb API key, which you can get at <a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">http://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api</a></p>

<h1>
<a name="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h1>

<p>To attach movie data to your posts, you use the <em>Import Tool</em> under the
<em>Movies</em> menu in your admin dashboard. The tool suggests movie matches
based on your post titles.</p>

<p>If you want to filter by a specific post type, you can configure that in
<em>Settings</em>, also in the <em>Movies</em> menu. For example, we use the Events
Calendar (Pro) plugin, which sets events to a post type of <code>tribe_events</code>.</p>

<p>Unless you've configured it to do otherwise, the import tool will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Import a backdrop image for the matching movie if one is available,
attach it to the post, and set it as the featured image.</li>
<li>Import a poster image for the matching movie if one is available and
attach it to the post. If no backdrop image was available, it will set
the poster image as the featured image.</li>
<li>Set a custom metadata field with the tmdb_id for the matching movie.</li>
<li>Store some other data about the movie that you can use in your theme's
templates (see below).</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="what-other-data-can-i-use-in-my-templates" class="anchor" href="#what-other-data-can-i-use-in-my-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What other data can I use in my templates?</h1>

<p>A basic example looks like::</p>

<pre><code>$movie = new Movie( $post-&gt;ID );
if( $movie-&gt;title )
    echo $movie-&gt;title;
if( $movie-&gt;genres )
    echo implode(", ", $movie-&gt;genres);
</code></pre>

<p>Properties of every Movie object::</p>

<pre><code>$movie-&gt;tmdb_id
$movie-&gt;title
$movie-&gt;year  # this is parsed from the tmdb release date (if found)
$movie-&gt;backdrop_path  # full url from your wp uploads dir
$movie-&gt;poster_path  # full url from your wp uploads dir
$movie-&gt;genres  # array in plain text, e.g. array('Action', 'Adventure')
$movie-&gt;imdb_id
$movie-&gt;runtime  # in minutes, e.g. 121
$movie-&gt;languages  # array in plain text, e.g. array('English')
$movie-&gt;overview  # tmdb's text synopsis of movie
</code></pre>

<p>Although every Movie object has these properties, they may be empty
depending on the source data. (If you haven't imported any movie data to
a post, conjuring a Movie object from that post will also return a valid
Movie object with all empty values.)</p>

<h1>
<a name="about-this-version" class="anchor" href="#about-this-version"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About This Version</h1>

<p>This is the first version of this plugin. It hasn't been tested
thoroughly, although so far it works for me. There is some code
cleanup to be done, especially in the admin screens. I'd like to
add tests, I just have no experience with testing WP plugins.</p>
